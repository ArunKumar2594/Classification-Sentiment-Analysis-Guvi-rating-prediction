TWITTER SENTIMENT ANALYSIS
The following project is about analyzing the sentiments of tweets on social networking website ‘Twitter’. The dataset for this project is scraped from Twitter. It contains 1,600,000 tweets extracted using Twitter API. It is a labeled dataset with tweets annotated with the sentiment (0 = negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive). It contains the following 6 fields:

target: the polarity of the tweet (0 = negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive)
ids: The id of the tweet .
date: The date of the tweet (Sat May 16 23:58:44 UTC 2009)
flag: The query. If there is no query, then this value is NO_QUERY.
user: The user that tweeted
text: The text of the tweet.
Design a classification model that correctly predicts the polarity of the tweets provided in the dataset.

RATINGS OF GUVI COURSES
The following project is about Guvi Courses. The dataset for this project contains information about Guvi courses in various categories, including course title, URL, price, number of subscribers, number of reviews, number of lectures, course level, rating, content duration, published timestamp, and subject. With this dataset, we can track the performance of courses and uncover opportunities to generate revenue. Design a regression model to predict the ratings given by the learners to the course

INSTAGRAM INFLUENCERS
Instagram is an American photo and video sharing social networking service founded in 2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, and later acquired by American company Facebook Inc., now known as Meta Platforms. The app allows users to share posts that can be shared publicly or with pre-approved followers. Instagram is very much used to influence people in a particular way for a specific issue - which can impact the order in some ways. The following dataset is about such influencers.

IMAGE CLASSIFICATION
Image classification refers to grouping the images based on similar features. It is a supervised learning approach in which you are given a labeled dataset. In this particular problem, you need to perform a binary classification of the given images. The binary classes identified are cats and dogs. After extracting the suitable features from the images, design a binary classifier that performs classification on the given data set. Also, evaluate the given classifier using all the evaluation metrics.
